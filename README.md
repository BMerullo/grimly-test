# Grimly Test

This repository serves as a testing ground for features and ideas related to the development of the **Grimly app**. Grimly is a React Native-based social media application where users can announce celebrity deaths and earn ratings based on the quality of their announcements.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to experiment with various technologies, frameworks, and implementations to support the Grimly app. This includes:

- Exploring React Native for mobile development.
- Testing out navigation solutions like Expo Router.
- Implementing authentication and form submissions.
- Experimenting with UI/UX components and layouts.

## Current Features Being Tested

- **React Native**: Learning and implementing core mobile app functionality.
- **Expo Router**: Managing navigation and routing in the app.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and better development practices.

## Usage

This repository is intended for experimentation and is not production-ready. Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and adapt ideas for your own projects.

## Future Plans

- Integration of backend services for user authentication.
- Real-time updates for user submissions and ratings.
- Fine-tuning UI elements to align with Grimly's branding.
